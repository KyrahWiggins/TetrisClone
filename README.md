How to Play Tetromino
Tetromino is a Tetris clone. Differently shaped blocks (each made up of four boxes) fall from the top of the screen, and the player must guide them down to form complete rows that have no gaps in them. When a complete row is formed, the row disappears and each row above it moves down one row.
The player tries to keep forming complete lines until the screen fills up and a new falling block cannot fit on the screen.
